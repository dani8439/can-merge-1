# Contributing

:partying_face: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute to `can-merge`! :partying_face:

`can-merge` is managed by [@LJHarb](https://github.com/ljharb), which is hosted on GitHub. 

To see a more comprehensive guide as to how to go about contributing to this project, including suggestions about how to make a PR, finding your first issue, submitting a good bug report, as well as coding conventions, please click [here](https://github.com/ljharb/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Installing `can-merge`

Export your [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) in your `.bash_profile`, `.zsh_profile`, etc:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN = "<github access token>"
```

Run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm link
```

Add CLI arguments as needed (see [Usage](./README.md#usage))

```bash
node .
```

Navigate to another repository on your computer, and run:

```bash
can-merge
```

You should be able to drop into the CLI, generate a token, and play around in the can-merge interface.

# Testing
`can-merge` uses the test framework [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape).

To run all tests for `can-merge`, run:

```
npm test
```
Or

```
npm run tests-only
```

There are multiple ways to run a test in isolation:

```
npx tape test/*test.js
```

```
node test/utils/*test.js
```

All of these methods will produce a TAP output, a Test Anything Protocol. This output can be very helpful when writing new tests for future features for `can-merge`. The TAP output produces a more thorough response to help diagnose breakages. You can read more about it [here](https://testanything.org/).

You may pipe in `tap-spec`, in order to pretty up the output, and format the TAP output like Mocha's spec reporter in several ways:

```
npx tape test/filterPullRequest.js | node_modules/.bin/tap-spec
```

```
npx tape test/filterPullRequest.js | npx tap-spec
```

If `tap-spec` is not your thing, there is also `faucet` a npm dependency, found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/faucet). It is a human-readable TAP summarizer.

To get the `faucet` command, do:

```
npm install -g faucet
```

Then just run the test file as above, with faucet piped in:

```
npx tape test/evaluateCommitStatus.js | faucet
```

Or give `faucet` a command of files:

```
faucet test/evaluateCommitStatus.js
```
